## ma-data-project
A data visualization project to practice modelling and web app development using the MEAN stack.
Core components of this project will focus on the following:
* Leverage DOCKER images as opposed to downloading components necessary for MEAN stack dev
* Build an application that can routinely update two datasets sourced from CMS (MA Enrollment & Quality Data)
* Establish a data model and relationship that allows for visualization and navigation of this data via a nice UI
* Enable users to export the data that they filter to
* Save queries and states of data filtration for ease of use later
* To support the above feature, add a layer of authentication so that folks need to log in to access their views
